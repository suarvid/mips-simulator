# What?
A simple CPU simulator based on the MIPS ISA, along with an assembler-front end, all written in Rust.

Simulator is single-cycle, no branch-prediction slots, only a limited subset of the
instructions available on real hardware.
I.e. no fancy stuff.

# How?
See the user-manual.pdf above.

# Why?
Mandatory assignment in Computer Architecture course at Ume√• Universty.
Also, fun and good Rust practice.

# Who?
Me and Hanna Littorin.
